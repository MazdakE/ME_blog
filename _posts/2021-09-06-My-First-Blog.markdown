# Introduction

In todays lecture we have learned basics about different cloud solutions such as IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) PaaS (Platform as a Service) and SaaS (Software as a Service). We also had some recap from our last course before the semester such as .NET Core, Razor Pages, Docker, API, Security, SOLID-principle, Dependency Injections and more.

The most exciting in todays lecture was the basics of cloud solutions. I will try to explain my personal view of 'The Cloud'.

The Cloud provides different sorts of Cloud Services. There are types as Private-, Public- and Hybrid Clouds. Each of them has there own attributes.

**Public Clouds** - Provides via internet and is accessible for public to either subscribe or buy. Servers and storages are owned by foreign suppliers and the client only pays for the resources being used.

**Private Clouds** - Are cloudes used in firm or organization and restricted from accessing data for some users. Private clouds is usually bought and the firm is responsible for startup and all kind of maintenance concerning the cloud. The positive part is that the firm has full jurisdiction over security and materials concerning the cloud instead of having a foreign provider be in charge over the cloud.

**Hybrid Clouds** - Is as is sounds a hybrid of both **public** and **private** clouds. The advantage is that with Hybrid Clouds your tasks can become more agile.

_If I'm not in right path about there types of clouds, please let med know so that I can update myself. Thanks!_

## Cloud Solutions and its benefits

- Information backup, replication and version controls in wrost case scenario like if it breaks for som reason.
- With cloud solutions you can easily scale your program or application. You can always add/remove resources, instances, storage and so on.
- More freedom such as you can easily and quickly structure your resources to match your applications new demands. Clouds are really beneficial for agile work.
- Easy distribution throughout the earth by setting up a server in your specific geo-location.
- Good accessibility.

## Cloud Solutions and its disadvantages

Even though there are many benefits with cloud services, the disadvantages are still there, such as:

- Costly to enlarge application.
- Security violations
- Hijacking is a common tactic in identity theft schemes in which the attacker uses the stolen account information. Also data loss.

## Cloud Services that is mostly used

Earlier mentioned there are three major types of services.

The first one that i would like to mention is **IaaS**: Infrastructure as a Service. this service is similar to hiring a virtual machines. Provider handles the infrastructure of the cloud while you as client can put your focal point and carry on with what you've been establishing. Client does not need to find out the technique behind the infrastructure, provider handles it. On the other hand the provider must guarantee safety and availability for the client.

The second one is **PaaS**: Platform as a Service. The benefits are as previous service IaaS, instead in this case the client can access more advanced tools to use. With PaaS the client can concentrate more on programming and development instead of concentraiting on the infrastructure or the platform. On the other hand this provides better agility to perform agile since the platform can now be reached through internet. Hosting globally will also be easier to make. Some platform restrictions still exists that you as a client should keep in mind. Afterwards you have to decide if your program or application can run fluently around that platform without bumping into issues or constraints.

Third and last one is **SaaS**: Software as a Service. The name pretty much describes it. Dropbox and Office365 are examples of SaaS. Software is shared and generally comes with a fee. It is easy to access this type of software, it is easy to give access to your employees and you can access the software wherever you are.

## Popular Providers Pricing Calculation on Cloud Services

Here I have made some price calculations to find different price spans from most popular Cloud providers and compare them to unpopular ones out there. In this scenario a client wishes for a server that should run a website with a database, with everything installed oon that server. The client caims:2 vCPU, 8GB RAM, 10GB Storage on a LINUX Server in Europe. The server should be up and running 24 hours 7 days a week.

I will list the providers down below. Start with the popular ones and go over to unpopular ones.

# Conclusion

What I can conclude is that the popular ones are far more expensive than the unpopular ones. There can be many factors to it. One of those are the security and the amount of tools provided from the popular ones. What you choose as a firm is pretty much up to how much you can afford and also how much you demand from your provider to provide.
