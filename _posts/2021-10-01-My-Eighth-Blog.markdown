# Introduction 
In this blog post we will talk about how to work with Azure Storage Service Blob, how to create a blob container and uploading blobs in our blob containers. I'll first create a C# Console Application, setting up a connection with my Azure Storage Service Blob which has our blob container with our files/blobs and a simple Web Application where we get our images from a specific blob container so that we can view the images inside our Azure application where we will publish our Web App. The main target of this exercise is to upload an image locally to our blob container in our blob storage and get the URL of that image so that we can view it from our web browser or display the images in our web app. I have included some methods with different functionality in my Console App so you can be able to store multiple blobs inside a blob container, you can also create a new blob container, select a specific blob container and also get a reminder that the blob container that you are creating already exists or not.
